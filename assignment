#Read 2 variables, named A and B and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable X. Print X.

A = int(input("Enter your number: "))
B = int((input("Enter your another number:  ")))
X = A + B
print("the sum of these two variables " + str(X))


#The formula to calculate the area of a circumference is defined as A = π . R2. Considering this problem that π = 3.14159. Calculate the area using the formula given in the problem description

R2 = float(input())
π = 3.14159
A = π*(R2*R2)
print(A)



#Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point.

A = float(input())
B = float(input())
average = ((A*3.5) + (B*7.5)) / (3.5+7.5)
print("value= %.5f" % average)


#Read three values (variables A, B and C), which are the three student's grades. Then, calculate the average, considering that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and the grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place

A = float(input())

B = float(input())

C = float(input())

average = (A/10 *2) + (B/10 *3) + (C/10 *5)

print(average)
